# MultiSnake
### A snake game with an infinite sort of quality to it

Instead of teleporting from one side of the game board to another, the snake just keeps going, simple right? Also, if you bite your tail you don't die. It's hard to explain, try it out. Unfortunately there's a small visual glitch on Firefox, Chrome (Mac) works fine, other browsers not tested.
